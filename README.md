Graydient WordPress Theme

Built with _s , Sass and Compass

To get started, open up `$ /graydient/wp-content/themes/graydient `

and run `compass watch`

The config.rb file watches the Sass folder and converts into style.css
```
# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:
http_path = "/"
css_dir = "/"
sass_dir = "sass"
```
